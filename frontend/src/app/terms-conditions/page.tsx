              <p><strong>1.2</strong> By paying an invoice, approving a quote or otherwise asking us to start work, you confirm that you have read and accepted these Terms.</p>
              <p><strong>1.3</strong> If you and RepuKeel sign a separate written agreement or quote for your case, that document applies together with these Terms. If they conflict, the written agreement or quote for your case prevails.</p>

              <p><strong>2.2</strong> Before starting, we assess whether your content is eligible for removal and tell you honestly what is realistic. We may recommend removal, suppression or a combination.</p>
              <p><strong>2.3</strong> Anything not listed in your quote or invoice is outside scope. Extra work can be added through a new or updated quote.</p>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <p><strong>8.1</strong> All prices are quoted in US dollars (USD), unless the quote says otherwise.</p>
              <p><strong>8.2</strong> We accept payment by Western Union, Remitly and cryptocurrency. We do not currently accept cards or PayPal.</p>
              <p><strong>8.3</strong> Payment details are given on your invoice. For Western Union and Remitly, you must send us the tracking number (MTCN or transfer reference) and a receipt. For crypto, you must send the transaction ID. Please double-check the receiver details before sending.</p>
              <p><strong>8.4</strong> Fees charged by Western Union, Remitly, banks, exchanges or the crypto network are paid by the sender. The full invoice amount must arrive with us. If a shortfall arises, we will ask you to pay the difference before work continues.</p>
              <p><strong>8.5</strong> Crypto payments must go to the wallet address and network on your invoice. Funds sent to the wrong address or network cannot be recovered by us. Amounts are calculated at the exchange rate on the invoice.</p>
              <p><strong>8.6</strong> Work begins after we have confirmed payment. Confirmation may take longer if transfer details are incomplete.</p>
              <p><strong>8.7</strong> For larger or multi-month plans, we may agree installments in writing. Work on later stages continues only while installments are paid on time.</p>
              <p><strong>8.8</strong> Fees are for our time, expertise and effort, and are due whether or not a platform accepts the request, except where Section 9 gives you a refund or credit.</p>
              <p><strong>8.9</strong> Taxes, duties and government charges in your country, if any, are your responsibility.</p>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <p><strong>9.1</strong> Removal services (for example, DMCA takedowns and policy-based review removals) are refundable in part if a removal we confirmed as eligible could not be obtained. In this case, we refund the unused portion of the fee or give you credit toward another RepuKeel service. Your choice.</p>
              <p><strong>9.2</strong> Suppression, reputation building and search cleanup campaigns rely on time and effort over months. Fees for work already done are not refundable. If a campaign ends early because of us, we refund the unused portion.</p>
              <p><strong>9.3</strong> Monitoring plans are billed for the period stated in your invoice. Cancelling stops renewal, and no refund is given for a period already started.</p>
              <p><strong>9.4</strong> Refunds are not available where the reason for non-removal is that you gave us incorrect or incomplete information, did not respond, edited or reported the content yourself, or where the content was removed but later re-posted by someone else.</p>
              <p><strong>9.5</strong> You may cancel at any time by written notice by WhatsApp or email. Work already completed up to the date of cancellation is charged.</p>
              <p><strong>9.6</strong> Approved refunds are sent within 7 to 14 business days by the same method you paid with, or by another method we agree. Transfer, bank and network fees are not refunded. Crypto refunds are made in the USD-equivalent amount at the time of refund, minus network fees.</p>
              <p><strong>9.7</strong> To request a refund, message us within 30 days of receiving your final report or of cancellation, whichever is earlier. We will review the request fairly and reply with a decision.</p>

              <p><strong>10.2</strong> DMCA notices and some platform reports may include your name, contact details and a description of the material. Platforms can pass these on to the other party. We will tell you before we submit anything that is going to reveal your details.</p>
              <p><strong>10.3</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or a valid legal order.</p>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <p><strong>11.1</strong> We depend on the policies and decisions of third parties. They can change their rules, refuse requests, restore content, or stop accepting submissions without notice, and RepuKeel is not responsible for their decisions.</p>
              <p><strong>11.2</strong> A DMCA counter-notice can lead a platform to restore content unless legal action is started. We will tell you about counter-notices and explain your options. Court action requires a licensed attorney and is outside our services.</p>
              <p><strong>11.3</strong> Suppression works by ranking better content above unwanted content. Search engines control rankings, so results are gradual and can change.</p>
              <p><strong>11.4</strong> Removing one result can make another existing result more visible. We will explain this risk before we start and work on such results as agreed.</p>
