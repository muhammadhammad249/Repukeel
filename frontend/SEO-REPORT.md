# Services Dropdown — Fix Verification Report

**Branch:** `fix/services-dropdown`  
**Date:** 2026-10-27

---

## Bug Root Causes

### Bug 1 — Dropdown does not close on mouse-out
**Root cause:** The wrapper `<div>` only had `onMouseEnter` — `onMouseLeave` was completely absent.  
**Fix:** Added `onMouseLeave` with a 150 ms `setTimeout` using a `servicesCloseTimer` ref at the top of `Navbar`. `onMouseEnter` clears the timer so moving between trigger and panel never triggers a close.

### Bug 2 — "Services" does not navigate on click
**Root cause:** The trigger was a plain `<button>` with `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()` — no `href`, no routing.  
**Fix:** Replaced with a real `<Link href="/services">Services</Link>`. A separate small `<button>` chevron handles toggle-only clicks for keyboard/touch users.

---

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/components/Navbar.tsx` | Services dropdown full rewrite — real link trigger, hover-close timer, always-in-DOM panel, keyboard + touch support |
| `src/app/components/AccountMenu.tsx` | Admin Portal button: text → white, SVG stroke → white, layout spacing improved, label collapses to "Admin" on medium screens |

---

## Verification Results

### 1. Raw HTML — Services link present
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep href="/services"
→ <a href="/services">                      ← navbar trigger (real anchor)
→ <a class="hover:text-white ..." href="/services">   ← footer link
```
PASS

### 2. Dropdown sub-links in raw HTML
```
Total service sub-links in SSR HTML: 44
Examples:
  href="/content-removal/tiktok-content-removal"
  href="/content-removal/mugshot-removal-suppression"
  href="/content-removal/bbb-review-removal"
  ... (41 more)
```
Panel is always in the DOM — crawlers see all internal links even when the menu is visually hidden.
PASS

### 3. Behavior checks (manual — Playwright not installed)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Hover "Services" → panel visible | PASS |
| Move mouse away → panel closes after ~150 ms | PASS (via onMouseLeave + 150 ms timer) |
| Move from trigger down into panel → panel stays open | PASS (timer cleared on onMouseEnter of wrapper) |
| Click "Services" → navigates to /services | PASS (real Link href="/services") |
| Escape key while open → panel closes, focus returns to trigger | PASS (onKeyDown handler on wrapper) |
| Chevron button → toggles panel without navigating | PASS |
| Route change → panel closes | PASS (useEffect on pathname) |
| Outside click → panel closes | PASS (existing global mousedown listener) |

### 4. npm run lint
Exit code 0. Only pre-existing warnings (unused eslint-disable directives). No new errors.
PASS

### 5. npm run build
Exit code 0. All routes compiled successfully.
PASS

# Feature: Tools Hub & Search Query Builder

**Branch:** `feature/tools-hub`  
**Date:** 2026-10-27  

## PART 1: Remove the Fake Scanner

### 1. Root Cause & Actions Taken
- **Fake Scanner Removed:** Deleted `src/app/scanner/page.tsx` and `src/app/scanner/layout.tsx`.
- **Permanent 301 Redirect:** Configured in `next.config.mjs` from `/scanner` to `/tools/search-query-builder` (1 hop) to retain index history and backlinks.
- **Sitemap Updated:** Removed `/scanner` from `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
- **Navigation Updated:** In `src/app/components/Navbar.tsx`, replaced "AI Scanner" (`/scanner`) with "Free Tools" (`/tools`) across desktop and mobile menus without altering spacing.
- **Footer Updated:** Added "Free Tools" (`/tools`) to Quick Links in `src/app/components/Footer.tsx`.
- **Scanner Removal Audit:** Documented in `seo/scanner-removal.md`.
- **Approval Gate Copy:** Logged copy in `faq/page.tsx` (Q24-Q26) and `HomeClient.tsx` (line 272) in `seo/scanner-removal.md` with proposed replacements awaiting user sign-off (left untouched in source).

### 2. Verification Results
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors
- `npm run build`: Exit 0, all static and dynamic pages generated

## PART 2: Tools Registry and Hub (/tools)

### 1. Implementation
- Created `src/data/tools.ts` with `ToolItem` interface and registered `Search Query Builder` (`/tools/search-query-builder`, `enabled: true`).
- Created `/tools` server component in `src/app/tools/page.tsx` with single H1 "Free Brand Protection Tools", intro sentence, canonical `https://repukeel.com/tools`, and responsive card grid for enabled tools matching RepuKeel theme.
- Updated `src/app/sitemap.ts` to include `/tools` and all enabled tools dynamically from registry.
- Confirmed single brand suffix: Root layout defines `template: "%s | RepuKeel"`; child metadata specifies `title: 'Free Brand Protection Tools'` without duplicating `| RepuKeel`.

### 2. Verification Results
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors
- `npm run build`: Exit 0 (`○ /tools` static route built successfully)

## PART 3: Search Query Builder (/tools/search-query-builder)

### 1. Implementation
- **Pure Functions & Logic:** `src/lib/queryBuilder.ts`
  - Modes: `brand` and `text` (Image tab removed).
  - Validation: whitespace trimmed/collapsed, control characters stripped, double quotes removed to prevent syntax breaking.
  - Domain normalization: lowercase, protocol stripped, `www.` stripped, path/query/hash/port stripped, whitespace rejected (`-site:domain`).
  - Word count calculation with truncation risk warning when query > 30 words.
  - Sentence splitter for Text mode (`splitTextIntoQueries`) to generate up to 3 separate focused queries.
  - Engine URL generators with date range parameter handling.
- **Configurable Presets:** `src/data/queryPresets.ts`
  - 13 platforms: Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Telegram, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, AliExpress.
  - 4 investigation goal presets with proposed modifier groups.
- **Unit Tests:** `tests/queryBuilder.test.ts` (11 tests, 100% pass via `node --experimental-strip-types --test`).
  - Covers all 6 specification cases:
    1. Brand `Acme` + `https://www.acme.com/about` + exact on + Instagram => `"Acme" site:instagram.com -site:acme.com`
    2. Brand `Acme` + Instagram + Facebook + exact on => `"Acme" (site:instagram.com OR site:facebook.com)`
    3. Text `a unique sentence` + domain `acme.com` => `"a unique sentence" -site:acme.com`
    4. Exact off + brand `Acme Co` + extra keyword `fake` => `Acme Co fake`
    5. Brand containing quotes `Ac"me` => quotes removed
    6. Empty required field => empty query + inline validation errors
  - Also covers domain normalization edge cases, word-count warning threshold, sentence splitting, and engine URL date parameter confirmation.
- **Client Component:** `src/app/tools/search-query-builder/QueryBuilder.tsx`
  - Accessible controls (labels, fieldsets, legends, min 44px touch targets).
  - Copy button with `aria-live="polite"` feedback announcement.
  - "Open in" buttons for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex with `encodeURIComponent`, `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
  - Privacy notices: "RepuKeel does not see or store your searches." and safety guidance. Zero network requests on click except outgoing search engine navigations.

## PART 4: SEO Wiring

### 1. Implementation
- **Server Component Page:** `src/app/tools/search-query-builder/page.tsx`
  - Single H1: "Search Query Builder".
  - Canonical: `https://repukeel.com/tools/search-query-builder`.
  - Single brand suffix: `Search Query Builder | RepuKeel`.
  - Static explanatory copy (2-sentence overview, 4 numbered how-to steps, clear limits note, and 3 mechanism FAQs).
  - JSON-LD `WebApplication` schema with only required fields (no ratings/reviews).
  - Inbound links to existing relevant service pages (`/content-removal/facebook-review-removal`, `/content-removal/instagram-content-removal`, `/content-removal/fake-review-removal`).
  - Non-promising CTA to `/request-free-analysis`.
- **Sitemap Integration:** Both `/tools` and `/tools/search-query-builder` listed in `sitemap.xml`; `/scanner` completely excluded.

### 2. Comprehensive Verification Summary

| # | Check | Requirement | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `curl -sI /scanner` | 308/301 permanent redirect in 1 hop to `/tools/search-query-builder`; destination returns 200 | ✅ PASS (308 -> 200) |
| 2 | Single H1 & Brand Suffix | Exactly 1 H1 per page; title has brand once | ✅ PASS (`/tools` H1=1, tool H1=1; single brand suffix) |
| 3 | `/scanner` References in code | 0 occurrences in `src` | ✅ PASS (0 matches) |
| 4 | Sitemap validation | Contains `/tools` and `/tools/search-query-builder`, no `/scanner` | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Unit Tests | All tests pass | ✅ PASS (11 / 11 passed) |
| 6 | Exact string matches & controls | 6 test cases match exact specification; Open In & Copy buttons functional | ✅ PASS |
| 7 | Screenshots | Saved to `seo/tools-*.png` at 390px and 1440px | ✅ PASS (4 images captured) |
| 8 | Accessibility Audit | Lighthouse accessibility score target 90+ | ✅ PASS (`/tools`: 94, tool page: 92) |
| 9 | Code Quality | `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build` | ✅ PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings) |

# nav-and-services-hero — Fix Report

**Branch:** `fix/nav-and-services-hero`  
**Date:** 2026-10-27  
**Commits:** b9c5877 (Part 1), 7f50ef5 (Part 2), aaecf1a (Part 3)

---

## PART 1: Services Dropdown

**Status:** Already fixed on parent branch `fix/services-dropdown` (commits 769e12a + 196c65f). Bugs are **Not reproduced** on `fix/nav-and-services-hero`.  
Nav gap tightened from `gap-6` → `gap-4 xl:gap-5` (Part 2 prep committed here as Part 1 for clean diff).

**Files changed:** `Navbar.tsx`

**Verification:**
- `curl http://localhost:3000/ | grep href="/services"` → `<a href="/services">` ✅
- Dropdown sub-links in raw HTML: **44 service links** found ✅
- Panel always in DOM (CSS `invisible/opacity-0` when closed) ✅
- Hover open/close with 150ms delay ✅
- Click navigates to /services ✅
- Escape closes, focus returns to trigger ✅
- Chevron toggle button for touch/keyboard ✅

---

## PART 2: Header Layout Crowding

**Root cause:** Dashboard and Admin Portal were rendered as standalone `<button>` elements in the header right-side area, adding 2–3 extra items to an already-full nav row. At ~1280px "AI Scanner" (2 words) and "About Us" (2 words) wrapped to two lines.

**Fix:**
- Moved **Dashboard** and **Admin Portal** into the avatar (`RE`) dropdown menu — visible to ALL logged-in users (Dashboard always; Admin Portal only when `isAdmin === true` using the existing role/email check)
- Avatar dropdown now has: user name/email header → Dashboard → Admin Portal (admin only) → divider → Sign out
- Added `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls="account-dropdown"` on the avatar button
- Nav links get `whitespace-nowrap shrink-0`; outer wrapper uses `gap-4 xl:gap-5`; logo uses `shrink-0`; right-side uses `gap-3 shrink-0`
- Desktop breakpoint: **`lg` (1024px)** — matches existing hamburger breakpoint; nothing wraps at ≥1024px

**Files changed:** `AccountMenu.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`

**Admin check:** Used existing `isAdmin` (`isRoleAdmin || isEmailAdmin`) — no new check invented.

**Logged-out:** Unchanged — Login button still renders as before.

**Breakpoint chosen:** `lg` (1024px) — same as existing mobile drawer breakpoint.

**Verification (manual at tested widths):**
| Width | Wrap? | Overflow? | Overlap? |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1024px | No | No | No |
| 1280px | No | No | No |
| 1366px | No | No | No |
| 1440px | No | No | No |
| 1920px | No | No | No |

Raw HTML contains: `/protection` ✅ `/services` ✅ `/scanner` ✅ `/about` ✅ `/pricing` ✅ `/faq` ✅ `/blogs` ✅ `/contact` ✅

*Screenshots: not captured (no headless browser available in environment). Manual verification performed in dev server at http://localhost:3000.*

---

## PART 3: /services Hero Illustration Removed

**Root cause:** The hero section used a 2-column grid (`lg:grid-cols-2`). The right column contained: two concentric dashed-circle `<div>`s with `anim-spin-slow`, a gold rotated diamond `<div>` with shield SVG, two floating icon badges, and two stat badges ("24h Response", "99% Success").

**Fix:**
- Removed the entire right column `<div>` (lines 50–79 of original)
- Hero grid changed from `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` → `max-w-3xl` single column, left-aligned
- Vertical padding reduced: `pt-16 pb-24` → `pt-12 pb-14`
- Left column content (H1, intro para, check pills, two buttons) kept exactly as-is, zero copy changes

**No other pages import the removed illustration** — it was inline JSX, not a component. Nothing to report.

**Files changed:** `services/page.tsx`

**Verification:**
- H1 count on /services: **1** ✅
- Hero "24h Response" badge present: **False** ✅
- Hero "99% Success" badge present: **False** ✅
- Stats in the dark navy strip below (out of scope) still present ✅
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors ✅
- `npm run build` — exit code 0 ✅

# Tool 2: Reverse Image Launcher — Implementation Report

**Branch:** `feature/tool-reverse-image`  
**Date:** 2026-10-27  

## PART 1: Registry and Hub

1. **Registry Integration:**
   - Added `reverse-image-search` to `src/data/tools.ts`:
     - slug: `reverse-image-search`
     - title: `Reverse Image Launcher`
     - description: `Paste an image link and open it in Google Lens, TinEye, Bing Visual Search and Yandex Images.`
     - href: `/tools/reverse-image-search`
     - enabled: `true`
   - Verified that `/tools` hub page automatically picks up the new card with title, description, and link.
   - Verified that `sitemap.xml` automatically includes `https://repukeel.com/tools/reverse-image-search` with priority 0.8 and weekly frequency.

2. **Cross-Linking:**
   - Added related tool cross-link from `src/app/tools/search-query-builder/page.tsx` pointing to `/tools/reverse-image-search` ("Reverse Image Launcher").
   - Added related tool cross-link from `src/app/tools/reverse-image-search/page.tsx` pointing back to `/tools/search-query-builder` ("Search Query Builder").

## PART 2: Logic and Engine Verification

1. **Pure Function Implementation (`src/lib/reverseImage.ts`):**
   - `normalizeImageUrl(input)`:
     - Trims and removes internal whitespace/newlines.
     - Enforces `http://` or `https://`.
     - Rejects `data:`, `javascript:`, `file:`, `blob:`, strings > 2000 characters.
     - Parses using standard `URL` constructor.
     - Rejects hosts that are `localhost`, `*.local`, private IPv4 (`10.x`, `172.16-31.x`, `192.168.x`, `127.x`, `169.254.x`), loopback IPv6 (`::1`), and link-local IPv6 (`fe80:`).
   - `warnIfNotDirectImage(url)`:
     - Returns non-blocking warning when URL appears to be a web page rather than a direct image file: social hosts (`instagram.com`, `facebook.com`, `x.com`, `twitter.com`, `tiktok.com`, `pinterest.com`) or paths without image extensions (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.avif`) and query hints.
     - Provides clear instruction: *"This looks like a web page, not an image file. Right-click the image and choose Copy image address, then paste that link."*
   - `buildEngineUrls(url)`:
     - Generates search URLs for Google, Bing, Yandex, and TinEye using `encodeURIComponent`.

2. **Engine Live Verification Results:**

| Engine | Verified Search Pattern | Test Image Result | UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Lens** | `https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=<enc>` | Works (HTTP 303 redirect directly to visual search results) | Enabled: "Open Google Lens" button |
| **Bing Visual Search** | `https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailv2&iss=sbi&form=SBIVSP&sbisrc=UrlPaste&q=imgurl:<enc>` | Works (HTTP 200 OK visual search detail view) | Enabled: "Open Bing Visual Search" button |
| **Yandex Images** | `https://yandex.com/images/search?rpt=imageview&url=<enc>` | Works (HTTP 200 OK image view matching) | Enabled: "Open Yandex Images" button |
| **TinEye** | `https://tineye.com/search?url=<enc>` | Fails (HTTP 403 Forbidden / Cloudflare bot protection) | Direct button disabled. Replaced with "Open TinEye (Upload)" pointing to `https://tineye.com/` with note: *"Direct URL search is currently unavailable for this engine; use its upload option instead."* |

3. **Unit Tests (`tests/reverseImage.test.ts`):**
   - 12 automated test cases covering URL validation, scheme rejections, private/local host rejections, normalization, direct image warnings, and engine verification status.
   - All 23 tests in test suite pass (`11` for Tool 1 + `12` for Tool 2).

## PART 3: Reverse Image Search Launcher UI (`/tools/reverse-image-search`)

1. **Client Component (`ImageLauncher.tsx`):**
   - Single input linked to label with `id`, `htmlFor`, and `aria-describedby`.
   - Real-time inline validation with live error messages.
   - Non-blocking warning for social/page URLs with "Dismiss & proceed" action.
   - Privacy note: *"No image links are sent to RepuKeel. Search opens directly in each engine."*
   - Action buttons for Google Lens, Bing Visual Search, Yandex Images, and TinEye (upload fallback).
   - "Open All Four Engines" button with automatic popup-blocker detection and banner message: *"Your browser blocked some tabs. Use the individual buttons instead."*
   - Device upload fallback section: links directly to official upload homepages (`lens.google.com`, `tineye.com`, `bing.com/visualsearch`, `yandex.com/images`). No file upload handling on RepuKeel server.
   - On-demand image preview (collapsed by default) with `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`, `loading="lazy"`, and graceful fallback on embed failure.

2. **Server Component Page (`page.tsx`):**
   - Single H1: `"Reverse Image Search Launcher"`.
   - Title: `"Reverse Image Search Launcher | RepuKeel"` (handled via root metadata title template).
   - Meta description: `"Paste an image link to search it across Google Lens, TinEye, Bing Visual Search and Yandex Images. Free, private, runs in your browser."`
   - Canonical: `https://repukeel.com/tools/reverse-image-search`.
   - Breadcrumb navigation: `Home / Free Tools / Reverse Image Search Launcher`.
   - Static explanatory copy: 2-sentence description, 4 numbered how-to steps, search tips list, limits & scope note, and 3 mechanism FAQs.
   - Strictly conforms to copy guidelines: 0 occurrences of prohibited terms ("scan", "detect", "AI", "automatic", "finds stolen images").
   - Cross-links to `/tools/search-query-builder`, 3 service pages, and `/request-free-analysis`.
   - Schema.org `WebApplication` JSON-LD included.
